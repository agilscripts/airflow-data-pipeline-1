# Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow

This project builds data pipelines using Apache Airflow to process music streaming data for Sparkify. The goal is to load data from S3 to Redshift and check its quality.

### Project Files

- **final_project.py**: The main script that runs the entire ETL pipeline.
- **plugins/operators/**: Custom operators to handle tasks:
  - `stage_redshift.py`: Moves data from S3 to Redshift.
  - `load_fact.py`: Loads data into the songplays table.
  - `load_dimension.py`: Loads data into dimension tables (users, songs, ect.).
  - `data_quality.py`: Checks if the data is correct.
- **plugins/udacity_helpers/sql_queries.py**: Contains SQL queries used for loading data.
- **assets/**: Contains images like DAG graphs.
- **venv/**: The virtual environment for dependencies.

### How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your AWS and Redshift connections in Airflow.

3. Run the `final_project` DAG in Airflow to start the process.
